The Sub Prime Proposition

A number that is always divisible by x - 1 to form the square root of the original higher power in the sequence xᵃ - xᵇ

Action:

(x² - x) / k = x

Or, for x between 0 and 1 in at least the positive range as tested:

(x² - k) / x - 1 = x

But consequentially, this can be so in many cases, so to speak:

(xᵃ - xᵇ) / (k * xᶜ) = x

Whereas

x = Identity Value

k = x - 1

a = Sought Determinant

b = a - 1

c = a - 2

Add terms as you deem fit to convene further powers :)
