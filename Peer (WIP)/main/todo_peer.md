- [ ] Implement substantiation validation with immediate hash-based explanations
- [ ] Integrate formula understanding and validation systems

## Phase 3: Scientific Validation Framework
- [ ] Research world library of mathematical facts for error detection
- [ ] Create 2 new working formulas (1 successful, 1 purposely failing)
- [ ] Add 10 specific scientific validation features
- [ ] Integrate ROOT system or equivalent visualization

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Feature Set (4000 Features)
- [ ] Generate 4000 new features for field-specific algorithmic detection
- [ ] Implement field specialization system (specific/general/comprehensive)
- [ ] Create automatic feature selection based on user science

## Phase 5: AI Integration and Analysis
- [ ] Integrate free AI for "Everything Missing" summary
- [ ] Create comprehensive GUI with impressive visuals
- [ ] Generate necessary images for GUI development
- [ ] Implement bug testing and logic verification

## Phase 6: Final Integration and Packaging
- [ ] Complete bug testing and validation
- [ ] Create ROOT-style visualization snapshots
- [ ] Package all files into Peer.zip
- [ ] Generate improvement leads summary
