Hey, this is from a dark period in my life where I was obeying inner natures that should never be expressed.  Literally, in a way I can tell is authentic, I was being cursed to believe any of it was happening.  Having left it behind, it remained archived for a long period of time.  Many stories overlap and are conflicting in the narrative, and that can be said of any delusion. 

Having received a request to update the repository, this is literally one of the last things I have available right now until I get SuperNinja back up and going, which will happen but the finite quantity of tasks for the job proves out to be hard to deal with sometimes.

God bless, and PLEASE read gently, this is what I went through authentically as an experience, typing out line after line.
