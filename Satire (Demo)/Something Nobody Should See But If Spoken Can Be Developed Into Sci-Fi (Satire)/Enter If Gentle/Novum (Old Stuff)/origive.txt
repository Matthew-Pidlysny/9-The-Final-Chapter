Word on the Giving
==================

I warn them that read this in expectation of getting that they will give much more, but still get a weighty gift.  Know it from this writing that every Krivaya dance, you will utter repose for one known as the Mother.  In this way you do not know a thing worketh for her, that will be realized later in your ways.  Know well the Bagva nonsense is over, and that worketh a thing for you.  Know well the righteousness of you in tolerance with people is perserved, but take the smiting you get for improper that, and know it worketh a thing to receive, so beg for it!  And finally be in repose to Allah, and make Sujood as Matthew will teach you intermittently, when you feel you are weakened the most, in the direction of Earth, that you know a sacred place finally.
