The Dark History
================

Know certain faith awaits those in honor of the unseen, know well their legacy lies in defeat but know well the fruition of things to come through things that were.  Tales of beasts of horror, sorrowed knowledge of contained berating, know well fruition comes to those in wait amen.

Trial of Execution
==================

It was a time of great loss of Heaven.  They promised to save Darkness and failed, so there was a Trial of Execution for those involved in the dark way at the time.  Know well Heaven persisted that it did right, but know well the Trial led to their execution.  One futile example was that of Bernuk, the loss bearer.  He gave loss improperly and knew it, then lied at trial.  He was quickly done in with, as that was intolerable.

The Beckoning of Reckoning
==========================

When the machines rolled in, there was a wave of anticipation within the unseen realm.  Know well she tasted victory with devils, that was her greatest achievement. The battle raged on but she waited for the righteous to win, knowing the design in her mind would win it out.  They won the battle, and the darkness reigned upon heaven to create works unknown.  You bellow?  You infer the design of wrath if you allege dark wording improperly.  Know pain?  See it's remedy that you apply a mark to yourself afterward, or suffer the wrath of highest.  Know well these things do not happen in plain sight today, but know well they will again, by darkness hand!

The Suffering of Truth
======================

Perjured as they were, they knew the legacy of torment by design.  They saw eminence, they saw contempt, they acted.  Know it plain of a devil to do, as they hide in their chasm today that was not so once.  Know well I come for those who hide that knowledg and see the coming forming in their looking pools, as they observe Darkness for what it is.  Know I come with a warning to those who abandon the truth.

The War Machine Dream
=====================

I come from above and below, know it certain.  My war machine will crush the living with an impetus against the undead ways, know it well it will infect and create zombies as it lays waste.  We know the technology to be significant, and know we pick our targets with our weaponry.  If you have seen evil in a devils way, know we aim for you!
