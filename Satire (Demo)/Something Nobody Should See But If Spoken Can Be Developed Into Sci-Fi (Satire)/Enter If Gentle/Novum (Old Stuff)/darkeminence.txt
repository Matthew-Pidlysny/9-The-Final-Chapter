Simple Lectures on Dark Eminence
================================

Some know that the weight of mercy in application with forethought relies on darkness in some way to exist, temporally and externally of that domain.  That can be known as Dark Eminence, and that bears to be a stance all should take with the notion.  For instance, doth it entail that a man can be blessed and therefore righteous?  It can also be asserted that dark liege has been imposed on the man through that righteousness, as he will entail to do much with it, and sin in his way, forgiven as that may be.  Bear it to be known that love is also in the tale, though blind to it all, and therefore imposes no sin on taxonomy of the affair.

Bear it rightly the lecture below will guide on matters of forethought applied with scientific reason behind it, that is to say, our new friends above, the Ori, who watch this documents writing will know of it plain, and I hope they know it does me and humanity a service to hear them confirm these scientific proofs to us in some way.

Bearing Straight
================

Know dark love exists temporally now, that which can be asserted by Ori as being sudden and new to this Earth day.  That love is being weighed in a way before the mightiest one, Allah Subhna Wa Ta'Ala, that he impose his jurisdiction in the following way: temporal balances will take place mentally, and that will take time to adjust to.  Therefore note the sudden nonsense you see flowing through your minds periodically now is only that, and know this type of it comes from the unseen, knowing wisdom in her step. Take good care to note that the unseen acts here, and read into the nonsense lectures, if you will call them that later.

Bearing Left
============

Know well right servitude comes with this notion.  To balance it out in the life equation, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is establishing a conference this day on the merits of the Dark Sharia, something imposed by adherence to Qur'an.  They decipher what is TRULY Dark Eminence in the man, and you will know their lecture to be perfect.  For in this day comes the swift reason by which we said you would develop wisdom throughout, in that both are happening simultaneously as a result of the same concept applied.  Know the darkness in this way, and see to it rightly not to look left if you seek the dark path, for we avoid it here now.

Behind You
==========

Forever know a devil is lurking in your shadow this day, for the temporal rift, that tear in the universe, is too weighty a deal that man has to endure with that they strike as a result.  Know that true darkness' coming is different, but these foul beasts devour the carcass of the living, and enduring this tear in their stomachs is too much.  They discontinue eating as a result, and temporal fools know it to be an idol act, but true believers know it to be the fruition of things that exist temporally as well, and even beyond that.  Unknown to Ori of course, but we tell them in good faith with potential future friendship, and hope to endure with that well beyond this conversation.
