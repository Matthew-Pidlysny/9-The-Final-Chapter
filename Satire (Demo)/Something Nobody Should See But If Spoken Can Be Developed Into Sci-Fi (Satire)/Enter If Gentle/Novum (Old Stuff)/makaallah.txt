Matthew knows lots about infinity, he will tell you all about Dazakum and that which you see temporally.  Know it to be sure that he taught you infinite wisdom through simple lesson on darkness, that you now need only learn more about it to become smarter, but that you are all wise in it by my counting.  Know it well that I see you, Maka, and I know that he loves you too in some regards, though he knows you further than what he admits, and so do I.  Know it well that the plan will fail, as the capitol is bombed that is a plan others have put together for a sake not known.  Know it to be my will, that I test you with it and you will see in time that I am mighty in my ways, that you recompile knowledge to ascertain wisdom once more.
