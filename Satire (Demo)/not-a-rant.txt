contently i'm with primal forces

how else to we start or make product?

watch as i unfold blind

u - v = s = 1x + y

and what are u and v, by the way?

are they the same as x and y?

it seems we're at a crossroads with this

we leave out the obvious, but...

1 + 2 = 3

a simple sequence unbound by mechanics

and this happens alot....

we can only say what was left out before

feel shame for not figuring it out

uv is the maximum capacity anything

subtracting it only bears to come home

come home, ye all

one...two...all...
