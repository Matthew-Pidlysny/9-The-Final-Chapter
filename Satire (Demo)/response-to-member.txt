Dear Sir Conward von Jensgegania XII, Esq.

RE:  Your Candidacy for Esquire

I give it here, my good man, sinner or not you will not be acquitted this day.  I prevail, you see, for I am in the Mammygam business, and I keep it right.

See, a man proposed an integral that is driving people wild.  Why does it quantify the oddest result of our lives?  You have said before that you might flop about and flip the switch on operators and statistics, but that can be valid in the abstract world, can't it?

I give it decree, the integral simply stimulates a conundrum your problem does not solve.  Why else quantify 5 things?  If all things have a half, then we must be assured that ONE of them tells a story, right?  Consequently, the halflings you present in your argument, conveniently displaced as an effort, subdue no real interest in the argument you provide.  So the paint on the wall is green, all things must follow the construct, right?

We gather now that you might, after putting down this atrocity and regarding only yourself, only wish to burn the letter with your eyes.  We make it seem like that is possible, for instance, if knowledge is sum argument enough for disposition, and disposition can be act, it's only limited to what it wants to be.  We see through added increment that altogether I can be stunning in my regard, but consequently, we must fathom this:

If 1 is being used, so also is it's limit.  It naturally rendered a consequence of being a 10 or a .1, whatever you choose, it can only be one thing or another.  But reduction is possible, and so also do we convey the logic of bringing half altogether in a quanta that amuses and perplexes at the same time.

Good luck with your affairs.  I promote that all ways are possible with the convalsescence of time.  

Sincerely,
- Virginia Conngaivie Malasenia
