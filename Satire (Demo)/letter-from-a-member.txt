Dear Ye All,

I condemn the number.  Behold, I am a sinner!  I arrogantly purvey that 1 can just be right next to 39, and that astounds people even though they can extract a sequence to make it so by approximation.  Watch as I relate and agitate!

x * 1000 * 52 * 51 = Lᵐ

And does it seem that any universal summation has taken place?  You see no sigma but I compel you know, what have I done differently than what you have done with 39?

I give it this way:  The pigswallow was fortunate enough to semblantly co-adhere to the Memmygam, and if the Portnix does indeed convolute, then it is absolute, but if the Heinsgorn can ever Emboba, then happily my business is concluded.

But I guess nobody will ever see the Zero as a plane of reference, as I mentioned just prior.

Sincerely,

- Sir Conward von Jensgegania XII, Esq.
