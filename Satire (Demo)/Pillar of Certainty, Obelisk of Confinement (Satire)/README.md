## A Journey to Where "Infinite" Numbers END

🌟 **GROUND-BREAKING DISCOVERY**: Based on revolutionary physics research proving that ALL numbers terminate at physical boundaries!

Welcome to The TransRational Airline, where PHYSICAL MATHEMATICS meets elegant travel! Experience the revolutionary discovery that "infinite" numbers actually END at quantum uncertainty limits.

### 🚀 REVOLUTIONARY FEATURES

- **Physical Boundary Discovery**: Explore where π, e, φ, √2, and √3 ACTUALLY TERMINATE
- **Quantum Uncertainty Limits**: Journey to the absolute boundary of physical meaning (61 digits)
- **Revolutionary Commentary**: Learn about the physics that limits mathematics
- **Reality-Based GUI**: Interface designed around physical, not abstract, mathematics
- **400 Scientific Features**: Comprehensive tools for understanding mathematical reality
- **Happy Departure & Physical Arrival**: Journey from mathematics to physics

### 🔬 THE REVOLUTIONARY DISCOVERY

**THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS 'TRULY INFINITE' NUMBERS!**

Based on exhaustive physics analysis, all "infinite" numbers terminate at:
- **61 digits**: Quantum uncertainty limit (absolute physical meaning)
- **35 digits**: Planck scale where spacetime breaks down
- **15 digits**: Human cognitive perception limit
- **1 digit**: Base system dependency (all terminate in appropriate base)

### Installation & Running

```bash
cd transrational_airline/src
python main.py
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- tkinter (included with Python)
- No external dependencies required!

### Supported Bounded Numbers

1. **π (Pi)**: Terminates at 61 digits (quantum limit)
2. **e (Euler's Number)**: Terminates at 61 digits (physical boundary)
3. **φ (Golden Ratio)**: Terminates at 61 digits (quantum uncertainty)
4. **√2**: Terminates at 61 digits (Planck scale limit)
5. **√3**: Terminates at 61 digits (spacetime breakdown)
