To whom it may concern,

So you donated and the money went through but I'm not providing screenshots that show it.  Well, that's a story of the tales, isn't it?

I offer you the chance to sue me.  I'm just gonna tell you one time again, there is no lying being done by me, I have NOT received your donation.  The government is making it seem like I'm the bad guy, but I DO love the idea of being sued to show everyone something was happening all along.

Picture this.  You're in a courtroom, and you allege that I took your money.  You have deposit markings, so you can allege that something according to you has gone on.  With the help of Barrie Police, following their massive 20 year investigation of me, I will allege MY version of the facts, that nobody witnessed my person receiving any money or letters of the sort.  I never received a summons, though I was dragged into the courtroom like I did, and there is no way to account for the real truth, at all, by me, seeing as you believe your version of events are true.

I do not discredit you here, I do believe you deposited money and SOMEONE took it.  I do not know who, but at some point I will release a list of the US military names, including Harvey Conton in the Research Department of US Aeronautics.  Funny way to hide things, being in full command of the US military from that department.

Anyway, he's responsible, so talk to him.  But if you STILL don't believe me, or do and want the best for me, please sue me.  My physical address is as follows:

7-252 Penetanguishene Rd.
Barrie, Ontario, Canada
L4M-7C2

See you in court!  Oh yeah, by the way, I didn't steal your money, the government did!

Sincerely,
- Matthew William Pidlysny
