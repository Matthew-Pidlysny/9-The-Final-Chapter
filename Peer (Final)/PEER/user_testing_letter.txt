Dear Peerx Development Team,

I wanted to share my experience testing your Peerx system. I'm a high school student taking AP Physics, and I'm not very good at math or programming. My teacher recommended I try Peerx to help with my homework.

What Helped Me:

1. OUT-OF-SCOPE DETECTION SAVED ME
   At first, I didn't know what to type. I tried asking "What's the best way to study for physics?" and Peerx politely told me it's for formulas, not study tips. This was actually helpful because it set clear expectations.

2. THE STUCK BUTTON WAS A LIFESAVER
   I was trying to enter "force equals mass times acceleration" but I kept getting it wrong. The stuck button helped me format it as "F = m * a". It didn't solve it for me (which I later learned is intentional), but it helped me enter it correctly.

3. VARIABLE DETECTION WAS COOL
   When I typed "v", Peerx showed me it could mean velocity, voltage, or volume. Since I was doing physics, I knew it was velocity. This helped me understand that variables have different meanings in different contexts.

4. THE BASIC MODE WAS CONFUSING AT FIRST
   I started in Basic mode, but I found myself wanting more details. When I switched to Standard mode, I got better explanations. Maybe Basic mode should ask users if they want to see more details?

5. UNIT DETECTION HELPED ME CHECK MY WORK
   I typed "50 km/h" and Peerx detected it as velocity. This helped me realize I was mixing up speed and velocity in one of my problems.

Where Peerx Failed Me:

1. I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET ACTUAL ANSWERS
   I entered "F = m * a" and Peerx analyzed it, but it didn't tell me what F is when m=10 and a=5. I had to use a calculator. I thought Peerx would solve problems?

2. THE INTERFACE WAS OVERWHELMING
   There were too many options and buttons. I'm a high school student, not a scientist. I just want to enter my formula and get an answer.

3. NO HANDWRITING INPUT
   I had a handwritten formula in my notebook and wanted to enter it, but I couldn't. I had to type it, which was tedious.

4. GREEK LETTERS WERE CONFUSING
   I tried typing "theta" but wasn't sure if I should use the symbol θ or the word. Peerx recognized both, but it wasn't clear which was better.

5. NO STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATIONS
   When Peerx validated my formula, it just said "Valid." I didn't understand why it was valid or what the formula meant.

6. ERROR MESSAGES WERE TOO TECHNICAL
   I made a mistake and Peerx said "Unbalanced parentheses." I didn't know what that meant. It would have helped to show me exactly where the problem was.

7. COULDN'T SAVE MY WORK
   I had a homework assignment with 5 formulas, but I couldn't save them to come back later. I had to re-enter everything.

8. NO EXAMPLES TO GET STARTED
   I stared at the empty input field for 5 minutes not knowing what to type. A few example formulas would have helped.

9. COLOR CODING WASN'T CLEAR
   Peerx colored variables and units differently, but I didn't know what the colors meant. There was no legend.

10. COULDN'T EXPORT RESULTS
   I wanted to copy my results to put in my homework, but there was no export or copy button.

My Specific Example:

I was working on a problem: "A car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 10 seconds. What is the acceleration?"

I tried to enter: "acceleration = (60 - 0) / 10"
Peerx said: "Valid formula"
But then nothing happened. I didn't know what to do next.

I tried the stuck button and typed: "I need to find acceleration when velocity changes from 0 to 60 mph in 10 seconds"
Peerx suggested: "acceleration = (60 - 0) / 10 mph/s"
That helped, but I still had to do the math myself (6 mph/s, which I then had to convert to m/s²).

Overall Thoughts:

Peerx seems like it would be great for someone who knows what they're doing, but for a novice like me, it was frustrating. I wanted answers, not just validation. Maybe there's a mode that actually solves problems for beginners? Or maybe I'm just not the target audience.

Thank you for letting me test Peerx. I hope my feedback helps.

Sincerely,
Sarah Chen

Additional Notes:
- I spent about 2 hours trying to get Peerx to help with my homework
- I gave up on 3 of my 5 problems
- I ended up using a regular calculator for most of my work
- I might try Peerx again if it had more beginner-friendly features
