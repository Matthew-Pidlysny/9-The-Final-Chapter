# Install system-wide
sudo make install
```

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Creating Demo Files

```cpp
// Create a K3 AI-enhanced file
auto k3_file = KardashevFileFactory::create_file(KardashevLevel::K3);
k3_file->save("my_ai_app.k3");
```

### Evaluating Software Quality

```cpp
// Evaluate a project for K4 readiness
KardashevEvaluationEngine engine;
auto result = engine.evaluate_project("/path/to/project", KardashevLevel::K4);

if (result.overall_score >= 0.8) {
    std::cout << "Project meets K4 standards!" << std::endl;
}
```

### Managing Dependencies

```cpp
// Resolve dependencies for a K5 project
KardashevDependencyManager manager;
auto resolution = manager.resolve_dependencies(dependencies);
manager.install_dependencies(resolution);
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Design Principles

1.  **Industrial Reliability**: Built for mission-critical applications
2.  **Scalability**: Handles enterprise-scale software evaluation
3.  **Future-Proof**: Supports quantum and multiversal computing paradigms
4.  **Cross-Language**: Universal compatibility across programming languages
5.  **Open Standards**: Transparent, well-documented evaluation criteria
