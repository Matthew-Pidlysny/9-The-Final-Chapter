THE UV REVELATION
=================

A personal journey through mathematical reality.
To discover the fundamental truth.
To witness the Reference-Agitation duality.

"Mathematics is not just about numbers and equations.
It is about the eternal dance between Reference and Agitation,
the two co-equal principles that govern all of reality."
