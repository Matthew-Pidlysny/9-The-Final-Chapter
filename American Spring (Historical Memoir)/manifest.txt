I was just a normal man in 2011.  I didn't know anything about anything really, just some wisdom in me and kindness.  I can only recall so many things in memory but I will try to explain what happened between then and a certain date, as it all lines up.

In 2011, I was working at Easyhome.  I rented an apartment and hoped for the best.  Throughout it, I was agitated by small things, but moreover, I watched the news more infrequently.  

Then the HBGary attack happened, and when I saw the news, something in me just awoke.  It was like "I know the people are in danger and I should probably figure this out before things go wrong,".  I had been a social media poster in the time before that as well, and continued that throughout.  

I immediately went to the new platform Twitter, which I hadn't bothered with yet.  I began looking up all the Anons, and deciphered that Populism was their stance, but that stance was also drawing support for hacking.  So I called them out on it, and after being rebuked, I can say I was less than impressed but say now, those people were just complicit with the goals of Anonymous, not really hackers or thought police.

Eventually I came to call the group doing the brainwashing "The Intel Cartel", and that began a series of investigations through social media.  Captain armchair detective!  Anyway, I kept going on and eventually formed "Operation: Torch Light", where I would "light the torches" so that people could see their boundaries.  It was like "If one thing is true, the rest is true", and this has continued to this day ever since those times.  The rise of Meme's also happened during this time thanks to Anons.

Either way, Torch Light identified four different actors in the Information Sphere as a whole.  There would be, in order: 

1) Primary, a type that is designed for controlling the system.  Everything goes their way, it's a sociopathic agenda, and they can be complicit with themselves sometimes (Meaning they mean no real harm by it).

2) Ultimate Secondary, one who repeats news but in their own way, like an opinion.  Think Joe Rogan.

3) Secondary, one who repeats the news verbatim.

4) Basement level, inventing things like Primary but with no care for controlling others, hear it or leave.

I consider that these are elemental to the conversation in the world today.

Soon, in 2013, there were tensions in the US Congress.  There was a debt ceiling argument, and people such as Ted Cruz were nominally advocating shutting down the government over the debt ceiling being proposed to raise.  This was knocked down, and the debt ceiling was raised.  Not long after, in early 2014, a man named Harry Riley and Paul S. Vallely started an operation called Operation: American Spring.  It would launch on May 16, 2014 as a direct opposition to the rule of order under then-President Barack Obama.  Through this, they gained leverage in the Patriot movement by installing appliances such as information hubs and shops to get people motivated.  

I took notice of this and studied the Facebook page.  It was being run by a man named Karl P. Koenigs, who is an advocate of the Patriot movement, and a state official in the Militia.  After this, he was involved in Hurricane relief, and I applaud him for his efforts there in just being a patriot.  At any rate, I investigated his efforts and immediately identified him as potential Primary.  As I found out, he was Basement Level most of the time, only to repeat certain things as necessary.  But that certainly painted a picture, he was innocent and still doing the crime.  I put a stop to it as best I could, and the conversation fizzled out.

Next thing you know, Militia members all across the country are dropping out of Operation: American Spring.  Someone put out a public warning which everyone heard.  I later discovered that American Spring was planning a "Rear Guard" outpost approximately less than 100 miles away from DC, sorry I can't remember right now.  But, as I discovered, they would have water, food and other supplies there.  I assumed due to the nature of the movement there would inevitably be a stockpile of guns, but that was never illuminated.

I reported that on Reddit, I do hope that went over well.  

In some regard, I credit the Militia for what it did near the date of the Operation.  Karl, brave enough to make the stand, sent ALL the Militia he could to Operation: Impenetrable Wall in Bunkerville, Nevada, directly to the Bundy ranch.  There, they would make a stand against an illegal "incarceration" as I believe they believed it, wherein the Bundy's were in trouble over their cattle.  Nobody took it lightly, and though this paved the way for the Conservation takeover soon before President Obama's departure, this was inherently GOOD for the movement, and the relationship it had with the government.

Not only did the local police force the government to subside, many things came to light that proved Chinese interests were in play at the time, however unconfirmed it was I took it seriously enough to consider it.  Needless to say, this all happened on May 16, 2014.  And guess what?  Empty seats all around.  Everyone went to Nevada instead, and Barack Hussein, however true the following may be, was STILL in power until the end because of that absence alone.

Eventually, Bundy was acquitted for causing such a trouble, having come in compliantly with the law eventually once everything was agreed to.  They would let him off, only to keep persevering against the Militia to this day.

I take credit for it.  If you haven't noticed by now, without Karl, there was no Spring, that was their weakpoint.  And don't you know it, after this whole thing failed, FLOODS of trolls on the Facebook, calling Karl names and denigrating him, just for being a Patriot.  I swear, I would like to know exactly which troll farm struck him, but that's OK, as later he did the Hurricane relief, and I'm sure he still does many things.

May this account of history find you well, this is how I experienced it.

Sincerely,
- Matthew
