# Version 7: Kardashev Scale Maximum - Metaphorical Ultimate Enhancement

## Kardashev Scale Analysis for Game Engine

### Understanding the Kardashev Scale
The Kardashev scale measures a civilization's technological advancement based on energy consumption:

- **Type I**: Planetary civilization (~10^16 watts)
- **Type II**: Stellar civilization (~10^26 watts) - Controls entire star's energy
- **Type III**: Galactic civilization (~10^36 watts) - Controls entire galaxy's energy
- **Type IV**: Universal civilization (~10^46 watts) - Controls entire universe's energy
- **Type V**: Multiversal civilization (~10^56 watts) - Controls multiple universes

### Translating to Game Engine Scale

For a game engine, the metaphorical Kardashev scale represents computational capability and feature scope:

**Type I Game Engine**: Current-gen AAA games (millions of features)
**Type II Game Engine**: Next-gen quantum computing games (billions of features)  
**Type III Game Engine**: Galactic simulation games (trillions of features)
**Type IV Game Engine**: Universal simulation games (quadrillions of features)
**Type V Game Engine**: Multiversal reality games (quintillions+ features)
