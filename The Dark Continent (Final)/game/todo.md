# Dark Continent C++ Game Development

## Phase 1: Research and Analysis
- [x] Extract and analyze game rules from PDF
- [x] Study game components and card structures
- [x] Understand current 4-player mechanics
- [x] Identify Mahdi character mechanics for replacement
- [x] Research Southern Hemisphere territories for 5th player
- [x] Analyze population counter system
- [x] Document existing card wording and effects

## Phase 2: Game Design for 5 Players
- [x] Replace Mahdi with European Union faction
- [x] Design 5th player (Southern Hemisphere faction)
- [x] Balance starting positions and resources
- [x] Adapt card distributions for 5 players
- [x] Modify turn order system
- [x] Update victory conditions for 5 players
- [x] Ensure all game mechanics work with new faction setup

## Phase 3: C++ Architecture Design
- [x] Design modular architecture with multiple .cpp/.h files
- [x] Plan file structure (aim for 30kb+ modules)
- [x] Choose appropriate C++ libraries and dependencies
- [x] Design federation/asynchronous play system
- [x] Plan UI framework for interactive gameplay
- [x] Design digital stacking system for pieces
- [x] Plan zoom functionality for country views

## Phase 4: Core Implementation (v1)
- [x] Implement game board and country system
- [x] Create player class hierarchy
- [x] Implement card system with exact wording preservation
- [x] Create piece stacking and counting system
- [x] Implement population counter
- [x] Create basic UI with zoom functionality
- [x] Implement federation/asynchronous play system
- [x] Add save/load functionality

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (v2)
- [x] Enhance UI with better graphics
- [x] Add new control or feature
- [x] Improve federation system
