# 9: The-Final-Chapter

Welcome to 9 Software!  This repository is a dedicated host to numerous programs that test the boundaries of normal mathematics and the natural sciences.  Our software includes breathrough
innovations in the field, from a revolutionary stance on sequential numeration through observations on the Hadwiger-Nelson Chromatic Plane, to a breakthrough development on Primes via a
revolutionary method of calculating "The Half Line", to many more.  Executables for a small selection of operating systems are available within the file directories.

# List of Programs

# 1:  Advanced Torsion

A compelling look at the visualization of fractions along a unit circle through their Torsion, utilizing numerous workshops to help students understand it in all it's forms.

# 2:  Diffusion Explorer

Explore our world using customizable 3D models and inputs.  Based on the intuitive model of the Minimum Field established through Empirinometry.

# 3:  Gas Tech

Study the fuels as a consumer, office person, scientist, or Gas Technician using a wide variety of workshops meant to improve consumer safety and labour productivity.

# 4:  Induction Ω

Study numerical induction and measure propensity with the capacity of a scientist.  Based on the science of Empirinometry.

# 5:  Omni-Directional Compass

Composes a substantiation formula through workshops using special relations and a custom scheme of determining mathematical truths using "The Varian" as a conditional relapse of factors.

# 6:  Primer

Primes can be distinct from other numbers for all sorts of reasons, but one most of all.  Find out what it is within this workshop loaded prestige of focus.
