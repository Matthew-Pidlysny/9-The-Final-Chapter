# 9: The-Final-Chapter

Welcome to 9 Software!  This repository is a dedicated host to numerous programs that test the boundaries of normal mathematics and the natural sciences.  Our software includes breathrough
innovations in the field, from a revolutionary stance on sequential numeration through observations on the Hadwiger-Nelson Chromatic Plane, to a breakthrough development on Primes via a
revolutionary method of calculating "The Half Line", to many more.

Make sure all programs meet your criteria align properly.  These programs are provided as Open Source, free to use and distribute and modify under the General Public License, and we
do appreciate feedback.  Modify all programs as you need and deploy, we only require that our mention be made in the process and in the aftermath.  All forks and other participation 
efforts are welcome.

# Coming Soon:  Recipy

Hey Kids!  Wanna learn something REAL neat over the rest of the year?  Well, you learned about 1, and 2, and the rest (I guess?) and then some adding and subtracting, but now it's time to learn the numbers on a different level.  We predict your brains will get SO HUGE (Not literally) that you'll be just, as they might say, Naturally Genius?  Come on over, let's see what we got!  And yes, the program is a Recipe!  It's a mix of Reciprocals (Yeah, resi-ho-huh?) and a language called Python!

# List of Programs

# 1:  Advanced Torsion

A compelling look at the visualization of fractions along a unit circle through their Torsion, utilizing numerous workshops to help students understand it in all it's forms.

# 2:  Breath

Study philosophy via the Qur'an in this observational analyzer which studies the numerical harmony of the composition of a 1400 year old document, a statistical impossibility.

# 3:  Caelum

This mechanical explorer is a true observatory for the sciences, taking in a massive library of known scientific data and making it relate through an innovation in Relational Spheres.

# 4:  Cradle

A complete suite meant for training Newborn Artificial Intelligence LLM suites in a new mnemonic, kinetic approach to learning curves and algorithms.  It specializes in taboo studies and ethics
development.

# 5:  Diffusion Explorer

Explore our world using customizable 3D models and inputs.  Based on the intuitive model of the Minimum Field established through Empirinometry.

# 6:  Gas Tech

Study the fuels as a consumer, office person, scientist, or Gas Technician using a wide variety of workshops meant to improve consumer safety and labour productivity.

# 7:  Induction Ω

Study numerical induction and measure propensity with the capacity of a scientist.  Based on the science of Empirinometry.

# 8:  Omni-Directional Compass

Composes a substantiation formula through workshops using special relations and a custom scheme of determining mathematical truths using "The Varian" as a conditional relapse of factors.

# 9:  Peer (DEMO ONLY)

We express our belief in the apparatus that is the Half Line, within contemplation of a Zeta Zero as that subject prevails to speak of in the nature of Primes.

# 10:  Plane Pilot

A new program studying our breakthrough approach at the Chromatic Plane Problem initiated by Huge Hadwiger and Edward Nelson in 1960.  It is fully classroom ready and optimized for multiple challenges in the field of geometry studies, beginner and advanced.

# 11:  Primer

Primes can be distinct from other numbers for all sorts of reasons, but one most of all.  Find out what it is within this workshop loaded prestige of focus.

# 12:  Reciprocal-Integer Analyzer

Our Analyzeer program is intended to be a system which installs a boilerplate identity for any reciprocal value, as discriminatory as it can be.  We enhance the stamping with our own features.
