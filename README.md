# 9: The-Final-Chapter

Welcome to 9 Software!  This repository is a dedicated host to numerous programs that test the boundaries of normal mathematics and the natural sciences.  Our software includes breathrough
innovations in the field, from a revolutionary stance on sequential numeration through observations on the Hadwiger-Nelson Chromatic Plane, to a breakthrough development on Primes via a
revolutionary method of calculating "The Half Line", to many more.  Executables for a small selection of operating systems are available within the file directories.

Make sure all programs meet your criteria align properly.  These programs are provided as Open Source, free to use and distribute and modify under the General Public License, and we
do appreciate feedback.  Modify all programs as you need and deploy, we only require that our mention be made in the process and in the aftermath.  All forks and other participation 
efforts are welcome.

# List of Programs

# 1:  Advanced Torsion

A compelling look at the visualization of fractions along a unit circle through their Torsion, utilizing numerous workshops to help students understand it in all it's forms.

# 2:  Breath

Study philosophy via the Qur'an in this observational analyzer which studies the numerical harmony of the composition of a 1400 year old document, a statistical impossibility.

# 3:  Diffusion Explorer

Explore our world using customizable 3D models and inputs.  Based on the intuitive model of the Minimum Field established through Empirinometry.

# 4:  Gas Tech

Study the fuels as a consumer, office person, scientist, or Gas Technician using a wide variety of workshops meant to improve consumer safety and labour productivity.

# 5:  Induction Ω

Study numerical induction and measure propensity with the capacity of a scientist.  Based on the science of Empirinometry.

# 6:  Omni-Directional Compass

Composes a substantiation formula through workshops using special relations and a custom scheme of determining mathematical truths using "The Varian" as a conditional relapse of factors.

# 7:  Primer

Primes can be distinct from other numbers for all sorts of reasons, but one most of all.  Find out what it is within this workshop loaded prestige of focus.
