# 9: The-Final-Chapter

Welcome to 9 Software!  This repository is a dedicated host to numerous programs that test the boundaries of normal mathematics and the natural sciences.  Our software includes breathrough
innovations in the field, from a revolutionary stance on sequential numeration through observations on the Hadwiger-Nelson Chromatic Plane, to a breakthrough development on Primes via a
revolutionary method of calculating "The Half Line", to many more.

Make sure all programs meet your criteria align properly.  These programs are provided as Open Source, free to use and distribute and modify under the General Public License, and we
do appreciate feedback.  Modify all programs as you need and deploy, we only require that our mention be made in the process and in the aftermath.  All forks and other participation 
efforts are welcome.

#  List of Research Document Types

#  Technical Manilla

These are document folders meant to be like a dossier that the creator of 9 Software would like to publish.  They are all upon request.  All documents may be distributed under GPL but not modified; extracting, however, or citing can happen.

#  Research Tote

These are mixed document/software packages, use them to your benefit as they only try to prove certain things.  All software is free to modify and distribute with credit, same rules as the Manilla documents.

#  Demo

These are products which are not full version and also do a number of things, but are mostly research materials that convey the full meaning of their intent.  GPL rules apply.

# List of Programs

# 1:  Advanced Torsion

A compelling look at the visualization of fractions along a unit circle through their Torsion, utilizing numerous workshops to help students understand it in all it's forms.

# 2:  AstraTechnica

Welcome to the world of corporate worldbuilding!  In this game, you'll be using a live time world clock to make your company shine!  Also a member of the "Kardashev Scale" line of games for future worldbuilding in the reality we live.

# 3:  Basso-Riello Trainer Pro

Basso Riello Trainer Pro is a cutting edge AI career training implement.  This program will help anyone seeking to enter the field of LLM training and covers other variants of models.  A 55-Lesson Plan is included in the suite for all necessary training augmentation purposes, and is fully AI enabled.

# 4:  Breath

Study philosophy via the Qur'an in this observational analyzer which studies the numerical harmony of the composition of a 1400 year old document, a statistical impossibility.

# 5:  Caelum

This mechanical explorer is a true observatory for the sciences, taking in a massive library of known scientific data and making it relate through an innovation in Relational Spheres.

# 6:  Cradle

A complete suite meant for training Newborn Artificial Intelligence LLM suites in a new mnemonic, kinetic approach to learning curves and algorithms.  It specializes in taboo studies and ethics
development.

# 7:  Diffusion Explorer

Explore our world using customizable 3D models and inputs.  Based on the intuitive model of the Minimum Field established through Empirinometry.

# 8:  Farha

The Rashiddun Caliphate.  A torn time in modern society, where bloodshed is told to be rampant.  We give history that actually IS true a second chance, telling it from the Muslim perspective.  We reinforce that Muslims are peaceful people by nature, and any self defence that is genuinely warranted is deserved, that will always stand to be our principle despite anything.  We give it to you and to all, and as for this game we give children the experience to play a Non-Haram game where you win a majority of the time with good effort, and ease of doing so.  Pleas enjoy it, we look forward to the enthusiasm of those who wish to please their Lord, another justice on the self well deserved.

# 9:  Gas Tech

Study the fuels as a consumer, office person, scientist, or Gas Technician using a wide variety of workshops meant to improve consumer safety and labour productivity.

# 10:  Induction Ω

Study numerical induction and measure propensity with the capacity of a scientist.  Based on the science of Empirinometry.

# 11:  Kardashev Suite

We hope to offer Humanity another thing they can use to their advantage in the Kardashev Suite.  It is a full file analyzer and dependency method using all the right biscuits, and using files .k1 through .k5, Humanity will begin to excel in a competitively highly computational world, free of error if we can help it but God always prevails in that, we will not escape it, but can help towards it.  5 workshops to fully enhance your new productivity!


# 12:  Omni-Directional Compass

Composes a substantiation formula through workshops using special relations and a custom scheme of determining mathematical truths using "The Varian" as a conditional relapse of factors.

# 13:  Peer

We release a new, MANDATORY work for all internet based researchers in the field.  We are upset with AI training as is, and know it will get better over time, but until people can ACTUALLY solve the Riemman Hypothesis with it, use this to confirm your theories, not it.  Make yourself "Crank-Proof" today!  We do not lie for your authentic experience pleasure, and you will indeed find out about your own creation.  We also offer a view on what you discovered through the lens of Substantiation from the Omni-Directional Compass.

# 14:  Plane Pilot

A new program studying our breakthrough approach at the Chromatic Plane Problem initiated by Huge Hadwiger and Edward Nelson in 1960.  It is fully classroom ready and optimized for multiple challenges in the field of geometry studies, beginner and advanced.

# 15:  Primer

Primes can be distinct from other numbers for all sorts of reasons, but one most of all.  Find out what it is within this workshop loaded prestige of focus.

# 16:  Privanna

By request we're doing a second game early.  This one features magical creatures fighting for their homeland.  We don't mean to make Devil nuisance a recurring them in our fantasy but it certainly is a potent figure in catastrophe.  The story, without spoilers, takes place on the Djinn Homeworld, and there are Humans exploring it guarded by a guardian.  All of a sudden, on the fateful turn, the Devils launch an 8 point invasion, inviting a total of 10 players if chosen, the minimum being 3.  Good rolls and excellent powers use will be the key in determining this fight!

# 17:  Reciprocal-Integer Analyzer

Our Analyzeer program is intended to be a system which installs a boilerplate identity for any reciprocal value, as discriminatory as it can be.  We enhance the stamping with our own features.

# 18:  Recipy

Hey Kids!  Wanna learn something REAL neat over the rest of the year?  Well, you learned about 1, and 2, and the rest (I guess?) and then some adding and subtracting, but now it's time to learn the numbers on a different level.  We predict your brains will get SO HUGE (Not literally) that you'll be just, as they might say, Naturally Genius?  Come on over, let's see what we got!  And yes, the program is a Recipe!  It's a mix of Reciprocals (Yeah, resi-ho-huh?) and a language called Python!  And to make it even better, we mixed in C Plus Plus (Another language) for the construction of this project.  It's a good modeler, something you'll be learning to do after you finish this program!

# 19:  Seek-R Simulator

Experience Esotericism on a level unseen!  With this new addition to the Kardashev line, and using our custom Stargazer graphics software, we make a VR capable game that is built to have everyone thinking twice, in an ethical way!

# 20:  The Dark Continent

Taking a pause from Education itself, the founder of 9 Software has shared his private creation with AI, and together, the research processor and guide pair created this game.  No spoilers, but it's a 5 player board game software engine revolving around the concept of the "Trump Card".  Maybe education in strategy via force x force battle style.  And, if you don't like to "fight", choose the right player!

# 21:  Unrh

Named after a mystical altar, the knowledge stemming from our research tote called Quantum Zeno reveals a deeper connection between numbers.  We wxplain how to start, how to go on, and how to end with numbers in a fancy, intuitive and AI enhanced manner.  Dig in, you'll be counting all over again, or not as the satire goes...
