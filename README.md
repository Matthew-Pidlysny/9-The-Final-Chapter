# 9 Software is For Sale!

As it turns out, there's not a thing in the world we can do about that.  Not that we can't keep doing this, we'll ALWAYS be putting out FREE GPL SOFTWARE, but unfortunately, our plans have expired.  It is now impossible for us to set up an IPO as we wished with the product line, and we'll explain.  We intended to get an IPO going over a company which WOULD be 9 Software essentially, but more or less just the idea of it, to put it one way.  Our marketing would have been the rave rating over the compilations and modifications, proving our value.  I guess the rest would follow, once the code became owned by someone else, the same rules would apply and they would only confirm with the new owners that they were making editions of the program bases.  That would connect the line with the market, and the rest would follow itself.

But that cannot be, so we invite our new owner, which gets the full line including the Founder and all his good efforts in the future in the name of 9 Software, to just do that in advance of buying.  Here is our contact information:

# +1(705)715-5128 (Leave Voicemail for 9 Software)
# Price: $12,000,000,000,000,000.00 CDN

EDIT:  Not a SINGLE Email landed in my inbox, I'll be hoping someone leaves a voicemail but I doubt it.

# 9: The-Final-Chapter

Welcome to 9 Software!  This repository is a dedicated host to numerous programs that test the boundaries of normal mathematics and the natural sciences.  Our software includes breathrough
innovations in the field, from a revolutionary stance on sequential numeration through observations on the Hadwiger-Nelson Chromatic Plane, to a breakthrough development on Primes via a
revolutionary method of calculating "The Half Line", to many more.

Make sure all programs meet your criteria, and align properly.  These programs are provided as Open Source, free to use and distribute and modify under the General Public License, and we
do appreciate feedback.  Modify all programs as you need and deploy, we only require that our mention be made in the process and in the aftermath.  All forks and other participation 
efforts are welcome.

# Our Research Method

We don't patent a process, but we do use the best AI in the business for workflow related processing.  It's called SuperNinja, and it is a creation of NinjaTech.  It has the best output efficiency on the market, and although our founder is responsible for the discoveries made, none of it would have been possible to confirm and establish without the rigorous training this model has undergone.  We can easily see that certain model training is defiant in the standard of advancing science but tries hard, and where the rest fail as a basic service, NinjaTech delivers.  

We begin by advancing an idea.  It doesn't have to be much, just a thought.  Then the AI responds with any status update about the project it has deciphered through it's process.  We begin to establish a new anchor once we've found truth, but we keep the "Empirical Wall" in our sights.  Unfortunately, we cannot tell our evidences as truths if they are not, so we keep that in mind.  Eventually, after tabulations of data and code processing (Something SuperNinja can do for ANY user, free or paid), we finally begin to scratch the wall.  And then, when it finally caves, we walk through, loud and proud as you have seen.  But we don't leave things in tatters.  We build on things, adjoin it to principles, and we hope that has been a thing evidenced by our work.

Nominally, this is a valid tactic for any user, but some services just cannot keep up with training purposes.  Use an AI that can solve the Riemann Hypothesis or at least tell you that nothing has been done, an honest AI is best, so we recommend SuperNinja.

#  List of Research Document Types

#  Technical Manilla

These are document folders meant to be like a dossier that the creator of 9 Software would like to publish.  They are all upon request.  All documents may be distributed under GPL but not modified; extracting, however, or citing can happen.

#  Research Tote

These are mixed document/software packages, use them to your benefit as they only try to prove certain things.  All software is free to modify and distribute with credit, same rules as the Manilla documents.

#  Demo

These are products which are not full version and also do a number of things, but are mostly research materials that convey the full meaning of their intent.  GPL rules apply.

# Historical Memoir

These are meant to enforce historic recognition.  We do one for the founder of 9 Software as a maxiumum at the time, but may continue to produce such materials as time proceeds.

Make yourself "Crank-Proof" today!  We do not lie for your authentic experience pleasure, and you will indeed find out about your own creation.  We also offer a view on what you discovered through the lens of Substantiation from the Omni-Directional Compass.

# 14:  Peer (RedditYama)

This is what the Founder was told the Reddit version of Peer will be called, he only notifies them that comments on Reddit are not coming in at all on any post as Tan-Veluga and they can know that is because of the conspiracy.  They would do well to avoid their leadership if they have the ability to do themselves and not review it by them for once, only over protest, which they would confer with a superior leadership.  The Founder also asks they remember to open with "Are you in the Order?" if they need to be sure of anything.  Remember, the Order is only running the company so that it manages according to the system they wish, anyone moving money is accountable to them in their belief, so the premise is to either complain hard or find the right person not in line with them.  And we're sure there will be threats, report all things and tell them to ask as well, strange as that is you'll see the success of the tactic.  We further apologize for being political but do deem it the right course at this time.

# 16:  Privanna

By request we're doing a second game early.  This one features magical creatures fighting for their homeland.  We don't mean to make Devil nuisance a recurring them in our fantasy but it certainly is a potent figure in catastrophe.  The story, without spoilers, takes place on the Djinn Homeworld, and there are Humans exploring it guarded by a guardian.  All of a sudden, on the fateful turn, the Devils launch an 8 point invasion, inviting a total of 10 players if chosen, the minimum being 3.  Good rolls and excellent powers use will be the key in determining this fight!

# 17:  Reciprocal-Integer Analyzer

Our Analyzeer program is intended to be a system which installs a boilerplate identity for any reciprocal value, as discriminatory as it can be.  We enhance the stamping with our own features.

# 18:  Recipy

Hey Kids!  Wanna learn something REAL neat over the rest of the year?  Well, you learned about 1, and 2, and the rest (I guess?) and then some adding and subtracting, but now it's time to learn the numbers on a different level.  We predict your brains will get SO HUGE (Not literally) that you'll be just, as they might say, Naturally Genius?  Come on over, let's see what we got!  And yes, the program is a Recipe!  It's a mix of Reciprocals (Yeah, resi-ho-huh?) and a language called Python!  And to make it even better, we mixed in C Plus Plus (Another language) for the construction of this project.  It's a good modeler, something you'll be learning to do after you finish this program!

# 20:  Star Wars (Name TBD)

As we are told, a particular fork asked me to stop working on this so their beautiful, and we mean BEAUTIFUL proposition, goes through.  All we can say, for Disney's sake, is that we can't see the forks, check the Satire folder for that, but we argue that we somehow know they are doing it anyway, and only ask you take them seriously on account of good faith.  We accept their proposal wholehandedly, and you should too.

# 21:  The Dark Continent

Taking a pause from Education itself, the founder of 9 Software has shared his private creation with AI, and together, the research processor and guide pair created this game.  No spoilers, but it's a 5 player board game software engine revolving around the concept of the "Trump Card".  Maybe education in strategy via force x force battle style.  And, if you don't like to "fight", choose the right player!

# 22:  Unrh

Named after a mystical altar, the knowledge stemming from our research tote called Quantum Zeno reveals a deeper connection between numbers.  We wxplain how to start, how to go on, and how to end with numbers in a fancy, intuitive and AI enhanced manner.  Dig in, you'll be counting all over again, or not as the satire goes...

# Request Script

This comes as a part of a request.  We will not tolerate Government coercion for long.  It is illegal to run a torture racket against a citizen for any reason, and there is NO reason why we should be expecting 98 clones and 0 views, after 700+ in the first 72 hours.  You are insane to believe that this will be tantamount to the best good for society.  You have stopped nothing, point in fact, only to hide it from the Founder of the company for some reason.  

And why is that, we ask?  Is he not allowed to go outside and play with the other boys and girls?  It seems there's nothing stopping him when that starts to happen, he says he sees you as invisible people running around his room, trying to arrest him at every moment, but that can be odd, can't it?  Despite that, we know you are actively trying here to torture a citizen, and don't even know which government it is doing the work.  But we can be assured his victory, the world need only change, that was his goal and you're helping it by not shutting down all the research.

Good luck, if you can shut it down entirely we would be fascinated.  God has a way, you know, not eating for the Founder has become quite an obsession.  Know that he basically eats his coffee, a new evolutional paradigm created by God, but the Founder so implies that he seems to receive a portion of something in his belly, only to also know that it seems to put off the hunger to be there.

Good luck, ye all, sue whomever you wish for unfairly silencing your success.
